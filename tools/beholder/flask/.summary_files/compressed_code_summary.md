./app.py
```
This Python code is an application using the Flask web framework, which integrates a language model for generating text based on an image input. The application has CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled, allowing it to handle cross-origin requests.

### Flask Application Setup:
- An instance of the Flask class is created with the name `app`.
- CORS is enabled for this application.

### Instantiate Language Model:
- The `Ollama` language model from `langchain.llms` is instantiated with a specified model called "mistral".

### Flask Routes:

#### `index` route `/` [GET, POST]:
This route handles the main page requests and image file uploads:
- If a GET request is received, it renders the `index.html` template.
- If a POST request is received with a file, it processes the file, generates a text prompt, and returns the rendered `response.html` template with the generated "roast" based on the image.

### Helper Functions:

#### `send_request_to_external_api(encoded_image: str, prompt: str) -> requests.Response`:
Sends a POST request to an API endpoint with a JSON payload containing an encoded image and a text prompt. Returns the response object from the request.

Parameters:
- `encoded_image`: A base64 encoded string representation of an image.
- `prompt`: A string containing the prompt for the language model.

#### `concatenate_results(response: requests.Response) -> (str, bool)`:
Iterates over the lines in a streaming response to concatenate a full text response, and returns a tuple consisting of the concatenated string and a boolean indicating if the "done" flag was present in the response.

Parameters:
- `response`: The streaming response object from the external API.

#### `generate_roast(prompt, image)`:
Main function that handles the image-to-text generation followed by a text roasting process:
- Encodes the provided `Image` object into base64.
- Sends a request to an external API with the encoded image and the given prompt.
- Concatenates the results from the response.
- Uses the `Ollama` language model to generate a "roast" based on the full description of the image.

Parameters:
- `prompt`: A string containing the prompt for the language model.
- `image`: An `Image` object from the PIL library representing the uploaded file.

### Notes:
1. The Flask application is configured to run in debug mode which should be disabled in a production environment for security reasons.
2. There are references to functionalities like `st.spinner()` and `st.write()` which seem to pertain to Streamlit, not Flask. This could indicate a past copy-paste error or a mix of intended frameworks that are not applicable in this Flask context.
3. The code does not appear to fully integrate with Streamlit, as Flask is being used as the web framework.
4. The local host URL "http://localhost:11434/api/generate" is hardcoded, indicating that the external API should be available at this address for processing the requests.
5. The `generate_roast` function contains code that is commented out and lacks a proper response handling mechanism in the case of a successful API request.
6. The functionality to display spinner messages or errors (`st.spinner`, `st.success`, `st.error`) are not native to Flask and seem to be incorrectly used in this context.

This summary captures the current state of the code; however, the code may require a thorough investigation to remove inconsistencies and potential issues, especially if integration with another frontend framework like Streamlit was intended or if the Streamlit code artifacts are a remnant of an incorrect merge.```

./templates/response.html
```
This code snippet represents an HTML document designed to display a user's "roast" (a playful insult) on a webpage. This document includes references to Bootstrap for styling and layout. Below is a summary of each part of the document:

1. **Doctype Declaration**: 
   `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

2. **HTML Element**: 
   `<html lang="en">` specifies that the primary language of the document is English.

3. **Head Section**:
   - `<meta>` tags are used to set the character set to UTF-8, compatibility with IE edge, and viewport for responsive design.
   - `<title>` defines the title of the document as "Roast Result".
   - Bootstrap's CSS is included through its CDN link for styling the components.
   
4. **Style Section**:
   - The styles provide visual design using background colors, padding, borders, shadows, and text alignment.
   - It styles the body to center its content and stretches to the full viewport height.
   - The `.response-container` class tailors the look of the container where the roast will appear.
   - The `.back-link` class styles the hyperlink for navigation ease.

5. **Body Section**:
   - Contains a `div` with a class of `response-container`.
   - An `<h1>` header that announces "Your Roast:".
   - A `<p>` tag meant to display the actual roast, which will be filled in by a server-side template engine, as indicated by the placeholder `{{ roast }}`.
   - An anchor `<a>` tag provides a back link to the home page (`/`), styled using the `.back-link` class.

6. **Bootstrap Bundle with Popper**:
   - Bootstrap and Popper.js JavaScript is included through their CDN for possibly enabling Bootstrap's JavaScript components.

**Additional Notes**: 
- The placeholder `{{ roast }}` suggests that this HTML is meant to be used with a templating engine (like Jinja2 for Python, Twig for PHP, etc.). The templating engine will replace the placeholder with the actual text of the roast when rendering the HTML to serve to the user.
- The `<link>` and `<script>` tags for Bootstrap indicate a reliance on an external third-party library for design components and JavaScript functionality.
- The document uses responsive design principles, as indicated by the viewport `<meta>` tag and Bootstrap's responsive CSS.
- Popper.js is included as part of the Bootstrap bundle to position tooltips and popovers. However, there is no visible usage in the current HTML, suggesting it's included for future features or by standard practice when using Bootstrap.
- The code lacks server-side scripting and is expected to be part of a web application where server-side code would dynamically generate the content for the placeholder.

Please ensure that the web server or framework you are using to serve this HTML supports the templating syntax and that Bootstrap's CDN is accessible when the HTML is loaded in the browser.```

./templates/index.html
```
This code represents the structure of a simple HTML webpage with Bootstrap styling. The page is intended for users to upload an image to "get roasted" â€” presumably a humorous or satirical service where the uploaded image is subjected to a light-hearted critique or joke. Below is a breakdown of the content and structure:

### Document Structure:
- **DOCTYPE declaration**: Declares the document to be HTML5.
- **HTML element**: Specifies the language as English.
- **Head section**: Contains meta tags for character encoding, compatibility, and viewport settings. It also includes the title of the page and a link to the Bootstrap CSS for styling.
- **Body section**: Holds the main content displayed to the user.

### Styling:
- **Body**: The body's background color is set, and it is styled to use Flexbox for centering the content vertically and horizontally. The default margin is removed to ensure the Flexbox centering works properly.
- **Upload Container**: This is a styled `div` with white background, padding, rounded corners, and a subtle box-shadow for depth.
- **Form Control**: Adjusts the border radius of form elements.
- **Button**: The primary button is styled with a custom green background color and a rounded border. It changes color slightly on hover to provide feedback to the user.
- **Heading**: The heading is centered and given a bottom margin.

### Content:
- **Form**:
  - **Action**: The form submits to the root of the current domain, as indicated by the action attribute `action="/"`.
  - **Method**: The `POST` method is used, suitable for file uploads.
  - **Enctype**: The form encoding type `multipart/form-data` is specified to allow for file upload.
  - **Input**: A file input element allows users to select a file from their system. The input is set as required, meaning the form cannot be submitted without selecting a file.
  - **Submit Button**: A styled button that submits the form.

### External Resources:
- **Bootstrap**: The Bootstrap framework is included to handle styling and responsive design.

### Summary:
The page is a single-button interface for uploading images as part of an image roasting service. The Bootstrap framework is used for styling to make the interface responsive and visually appealing. The form uses a POST method to submit the selected file to the server, but there is no script provided to handle the upload on the server side.```
