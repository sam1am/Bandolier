# README.md for TypingMind Export/Import Utility

## üìñ Project Description

The TypingMind Export/Import Utility is designed to facilitate the conversion of chat conversations from a JSON format into organized Markdown files. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive guide on the JSON structure utilized by the hypothetical TypingMind software for exporting and importing data including chat sessions, user settings, folder organization, and various metadata.

üîç This project includes:

- A Python script (`export_all_to_md.py`) that exports chat conversations to Markdown.
- Documentation on handling long-running HTTP requests in APIs.
- Code for fetching conversation structures and generating such Markdown files.
- An outline of the expected JSON schema (`schema.md`) as used by TypingMind.

## üõ† Installation

To get started with the TypingMind Export/Import Utility:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/TypingMind-Utility.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd TypingMind-Utility
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Export JSON to Markdown

To convert your TypingMind chat conversations from a JSON file into Markdown files, use the included script `export_all_to_md.py`:

1. Run the script and provide the path to your JSON file:
   ```
   python export_all_to_md.py path/to/your/chatdata.json
   ```
   
The script executes the following tasks:

- Reads the JSON file and exports each chat under `chatsInFolder` into a sanitized folder structure with Markdown files.
- Chat content is formatted within Markdown files with bold timestamp and roles included.
- Error handling ensures you're notified if something goes awry during the export.

### Understanding the TypingMind JSON Schema

Refer to the documentation in `schema.md` for an overview of the JSON structure preferred by TypingMind. It outlines the various fields and objects, including `checksum`, `data`, `chats`, and `folders`, among others.
