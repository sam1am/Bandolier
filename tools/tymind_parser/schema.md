# TypingMind JSON Structure Documentation

## Introduction
This document outlines the JSON output structure for TypingMind, which includes chat data, user settings, and metadata. This standardized structure is used for data export and import procedures, allowing users and external systems to interact with TypingMind's data programmatically.

## Schema Definition

### Top-Level Fields

- `checksum` (`string`): A validation hash to verify the integrity of the JSON data.
- `data` (`object`): The container object for all the TypingMind data, encompassing chats, folders, and related settings.

### Data Structure

#### `chats` (array of `object`): Collection of individual chat objects.
  
- Each chat object contains:
  - `createdAt` (`string`): The creation timestamp of the chat session in ISO 8601 format.

  - `folderID` (`string`): The identifier of the folder containing this chat session.

#### `folders` (array of `object`): Collection of folder objects for organizing chats.

- Each folder object contains:
  - `id` (`string`): A unique identifier for the folder.
  - `title` (`string`): The display title of the folder.
  - `new` (`boolean`): Indicates if this is a newly created folder.
  - `open` (`boolean`): Indicates if the folder is currently open.

  - `syncedAt` (`null` or `string`): The last sync timestamp for the folder.
  - `order` (`integer`): An integer representing the folder's order in a list.

#### `chatsInFolder` (`object`): An object representing the mapping between folders and their respective chats.

- Each folder is represented by a unique key (folder ID), which maps to an array of chat IDs contained within that folder.
  
  - Example:
    - `fo-8805f4db-5aeb-4894-9181-e2c25c4a5f31` (array of `string`): An array of chat session identifiers belonging to this folder.
