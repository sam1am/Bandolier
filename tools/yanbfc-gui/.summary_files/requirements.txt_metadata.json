{"hash": "f02113237a5a5fff03e34c9eeeb46640", "summary": "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It offers an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. It's also commonly used in Jupyter notebooks for inline plots.\n\nHere is a high-level summary of key components and concepts in Matplotlib:\n\n1. `pyplot` module: Provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting and is stateful, i.e., it keeps track of the current figure and plotting area, and the plotting functions are directed to the current axes.\n\n2. `Figure`: The top-level container for all plot elements. Represents the overall window or page where everything is drawn.\n\n3. `Axes`: This is what you might think of as 'a plot.' It is the region of the image with the data space and can contain multiple `Axis` objects.\n\n4. `Axis`: These are the number-line-like objects and take care of setting the graph limits and generating the ticks and tick labels.\n\n5. `Artist`: Everything you can see on the figure is an artist, including `Figure`, `Axes`, and `Axis` objects. Even the text is considered an artist.\n\nHere are some common functions you might encounter when using Matplotlib:\n\n- `plt.figure()`: Creates a new figure.\n- `plt.plot()`: Plot y versus x as lines and/or markers.\n- `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`: Set the labels of the x-axis and y-axis.\n- `plt.title()`: Set a title for the axes.\n- `plt.legend()`: Place a legend on the axes.\n- `plt.show()`: Display a figure to the user.\n- `plt.savefig()`: Save the current figure.\n- `plt.subplots()`: Create a figure and a set of subplots.\n\nExample usage for creating a simple line plot:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Data for plotting\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ny = [10, 20, 25, 30]\n# Create a new figure and an axes to plot in\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n# Plot data on the axes\nax.plot(x, y)\n# Label the axes\nax.set_xlabel('X axis label')\nax.set_ylabel('Y axis label')\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nWhen documenting or referencing Matplotlib in code, always mention the version of Matplotlib being used, as some functionality can change between versions. Additionally, it's useful to note which back-end is in use, as this can affect how plots are displayed or saved."}
