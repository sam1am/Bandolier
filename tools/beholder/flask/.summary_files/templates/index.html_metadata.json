{"hash": "080f7453b13d56c3dc078e986c66fe4e", "summary": "This code represents the structure of a simple HTML webpage with Bootstrap styling. The page is intended for users to upload an image to \"get roasted\" \u2014 presumably a humorous or satirical service where the uploaded image is subjected to a light-hearted critique or joke. Below is a breakdown of the content and structure:\n\n### Document Structure:\n- **DOCTYPE declaration**: Declares the document to be HTML5.\n- **HTML element**: Specifies the language as English.\n- **Head section**: Contains meta tags for character encoding, compatibility, and viewport settings. It also includes the title of the page and a link to the Bootstrap CSS for styling.\n- **Body section**: Holds the main content displayed to the user.\n\n### Styling:\n- **Body**: The body's background color is set, and it is styled to use Flexbox for centering the content vertically and horizontally. The default margin is removed to ensure the Flexbox centering works properly.\n- **Upload Container**: This is a styled `div` with white background, padding, rounded corners, and a subtle box-shadow for depth.\n- **Form Control**: Adjusts the border radius of form elements.\n- **Button**: The primary button is styled with a custom green background color and a rounded border. It changes color slightly on hover to provide feedback to the user.\n- **Heading**: The heading is centered and given a bottom margin.\n\n### Content:\n- **Form**:\n  - **Action**: The form submits to the root of the current domain, as indicated by the action attribute `action=\"/\"`.\n  - **Method**: The `POST` method is used, suitable for file uploads.\n  - **Enctype**: The form encoding type `multipart/form-data` is specified to allow for file upload.\n  - **Input**: A file input element allows users to select a file from their system. The input is set as required, meaning the form cannot be submitted without selecting a file.\n  - **Submit Button**: A styled button that submits the form.\n\n### External Resources:\n- **Bootstrap**: The Bootstrap framework is included to handle styling and responsive design.\n\n### Summary:\nThe page is a single-button interface for uploading images as part of an image roasting service. The Bootstrap framework is used for styling to make the interface responsive and visually appealing. The form uses a POST method to submit the selected file to the server, but there is no script provided to handle the upload on the server side."}
