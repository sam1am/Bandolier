        "title": "Person Centred Therapy Demonstration: A Contemporary Approach (No Commentary)",
        "description": "This video illustrates person-centred counselling with a client, Martha (portrayed by an actor). It presents a full session with no commentary. \n\nMartha, in her mid-20s, has come to counselling because she is feeling low: mainly centred around problems she is having with her boyfriend. Josh. She is not sure if she wants to continue in the relationship and is uncertain what to do. Martha loves Josh and finds him fun and exciting, but also experiences him as 'flaky', unreliable, and immature. This is the third session. \n\nThe therapy being practiced in this video is person-centred, but with a more 'experiential' focus than a classical, 'non-directive' approach. Empathy, acceptance, and congruence should all be in evidence here; but Martha is also encouraged to connect with some of her deeper feelings and experiences in relation to Josh. A description of the different currents in the person-centred approach can be found at https://mick-cooper.squarespace.com/new-blog/2022/11/3/person-centred-therapy-four-currents  Of course this is just one approach to person-centred therapy and different person-centred therapist may understand, and practice, the approach in very different ways. \n\nYou may find it useful to consider the practice in relation to person-centred competencies, a contemporary detailing of which are available through the 'PCEPS' form: https://www.bacp.co.uk/media/5752/pceps-therapy-adherence-scale.pdf",

        "description": "Hello my charming canaries! I'm very excited about this video, I've seen EMDR therapy done as ASMR before, although it still isn't SUPER popular.. so I wanted to do my own take on it! \n\nNow for those of you who haven't heard of EMDR; eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is a real therapy where you think about a bad memory at the same time as trying to follow a simple task (such as following a finger).. and basically since your brain is overloaded with 2 tasks at the same time, over time it can help you process past memories in a more positive way. \n\nI do have to offer a disclaimer that I did do lots of research for this one, but that in no way makes me a professional therapist! This video is meant to help with mild anxiety and insomnia, but in no way does this replace real therapy. If you're not feeling up to this kind of video, I have many other relaxation focused videos to choose from.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nHope you all enjoy, I know that I've found these roleplays really helpful myself in the past!\n\n--------\nIf you'd like to donate towards props and improved equipment, here's my tip jar:\ud83d\ude4f\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/maplewhispers \ud83d\udc95\n\n\nFree ways to support the channel: \n\ud83d\udc95 Subscribe!\n\ud83d\udd14 Ring the bell (Quietly)\n\u2705 Smash that like button (Gently and Softly)\n\u270d\ufe0f Leave me a comment\n\nIt means the world to me to have your support to continue making content for you all!~ \ud83d\udc95\n\n\nIf you'd like to reach out for a comment, request, or a custom video inquiry I can be reached at:\n\nmaplewhispersasmr@gmail.com",

We sound like a cult, because we probably are.\n\nI\u2019ve been getting so many requests to do another EMDR therapy session, and, I\u2019ve answered! EMDR stands for \u201cEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\u201d, and it\u2019s where a therapist uses single or bilateral stimulation (repetitive movements or sound) to manipulate short term memory (with a trauma memory remembered in that short term) into forgetting a stressful or \u201ctraumatic\u201d event that\u2019s happened. Many EMDR patients report feeling ASMR in these therapies and therefore I started to replicate my own from my own experiences years ago. I do this with the most respect, love, and safety as possible, and so far it\u2019s received many positive responses and outcomes. I hope it will do the same for you too, family!\n\nBut as always, before I begin, I want to preface with the fact that I am NOT a medical professional, and these videos are for relaxation and self help alone. Nothing I am doing in this Asmr video is meant to diagnose or treat any underlying or undiagnosed problems. I\u2019m sure you understand, but I have to make sure this is mentioned. I hope you enjoy this whether it be to help you on your own journey, or simply to relax.. know no matter what it is, you\u2019re in a safe space. \n\nPlease check out my other EMDR series, and sleep well family!\n\nASMR EMDR SESSION 4\nhttps://youtu.be/ogh9oa7ulPo\nASMR EMDR SESSION 3\nhttps://youtu.be/RZr8cuaNE4w\nASMR EMDR SESSION 2\nhttps://youtu.be/FAWBLG_LarA\n1ST EMDR SESSION, 2019\nhttps://youtu.be/JjpUjashlUU\nASMR EMDR FT.

PATREON \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/whisperlatina\n\ud83d\udccc Direct DONATIONS \u25ba https://www.paypal.me/whisperlatina  \n\nIn this ASMR video, I'll guide you through an EMDR therapy session using soothing auditory and visual triggers to help you relax and find emotional healing. Experience the gentle voice, calming hand movements, and subtle visual cues as we explore the benefits of EMDR in a serene, ASMR-inspired setting. \n\n\u26a0\ufe0fIm not a professional so please just watch this for entertainment purposes only.\n\nEMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. It is a psychotherapy approach that was originally developed to help individuals who have experienced traumatic events, especially those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). EMDR therapy involves a structured eight-phase process in which the therapist helps the individual process distressing memories and thoughts associated with the trauma.\n\nDuring EMDR sessions, individuals typically recall traumatic memories while simultaneously focusing on a therapist-directed bilateral stimulation, which can involve guided eye movements, auditory tones, or tactile sensations. This bilateral stimulation is believed to help the individual process and reorganize traumatic memories, reducing their emotional intensity and negative impact.\n\nEMDR is used not only for PTSD but also for a range of other issues, including anxiety disorders, phobias, and emotional disturbances related to various life experiences. It has gained popularity as an effective therapeutic approach in the mental health field. However, it's essential to seek EMDR therapy from a trained and licensed therapist, as the process can be complex and requires professional guidance.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Inspired by Karuna Satori Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f67E-poU8N0 \n\n\ud83d\udccc All Social Networks: https://linktr.ee/asmrjonie\n\ud83d\udccc EMAIL: latinawhisper@gmail.com\n\ud83c\udf81 Channel Wishlist: https://thronegifts.com/u/asmrjonie\n\n#ASMR #Roleplay #PersonalAttention",

We'll be doing an EMDR therapeutic session (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), which is designed to help heal from painful memories. So if you're not feeling up to that, that's completely fine! \n\nI do want to add some disclaimers though that I am not a professional or trained therapist. I do lots of research when I do a more serious video such as this, but it's no replacement for actual therapy. My hope is to help people who can't afford or just can't get to a therapist for whatever reason. Please use your own discretion if this video is right for you, and please click away if you ever feel uneasy. \n\nThis video is made to also be ASMR, and as such this video should be mainly considered a form of entertainment. So I will include lots of visual triggers, such as follow my fingers, follow the light, look over here, my crystal pendulum. And will also include some countdowns, some deep breathing exercises, some guided meditation, and more. I'll be softly speaking throughout the video. \n\nHope you enjoy, and see you soon! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n--------\nIf you'd like to donate towards props and improved equipment, here's my tip jar:\ud83d\ude4f\nhttps://www.paypal.com/paypalme/maplewhispers \ud83d\udc95\n\nCheck out my Patreon: patreon.com/maplewhispersasmr\n\nFree ways to support the channel: \n\ud83d\udc95 Subscribe!\n\ud83d\udd14 Ring the bell (Quietly)\n\u2705 Smash that like button (Gently and Softly)\n\u270d\ufe0f Leave me a comment\n\nIt means the world to me to have your support to continue making content for you all!~ \ud83d\udc95\n\n\nFollow me on Instagram for some of my shenanigans: https://www.instagram.com/maple.whispers\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to reach out for a comment, request, or a custom video inquiry I can be reached at:\n\nMaplewhispersasmr@gmail.com\n\n\n#asmr #relaxation #sleep #tingles",
