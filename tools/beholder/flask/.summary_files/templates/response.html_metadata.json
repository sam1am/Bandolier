{"hash": "d897c68aad6c8a0a65dc725dbf586678", "summary": "This code snippet represents an HTML document designed to display a user's \"roast\" (a playful insult) on a webpage. This document includes references to Bootstrap for styling and layout. Below is a summary of each part of the document:\n\n1. **Doctype Declaration**: \n   `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.\n\n2. **HTML Element**: \n   `<html lang=\"en\">` specifies that the primary language of the document is English.\n\n3. **Head Section**:\n   - `<meta>` tags are used to set the character set to UTF-8, compatibility with IE edge, and viewport for responsive design.\n   - `<title>` defines the title of the document as \"Roast Result\".\n   - Bootstrap's CSS is included through its CDN link for styling the components.\n   \n4. **Style Section**:\n   - The styles provide visual design using background colors, padding, borders, shadows, and text alignment.\n   - It styles the body to center its content and stretches to the full viewport height.\n   - The `.response-container` class tailors the look of the container where the roast will appear.\n   - The `.back-link` class styles the hyperlink for navigation ease.\n\n5. **Body Section**:\n   - Contains a `div` with a class of `response-container`.\n   - An `<h1>` header that announces \"Your Roast:\".\n   - A `<p>` tag meant to display the actual roast, which will be filled in by a server-side template engine, as indicated by the placeholder `{{ roast }}`.\n   - An anchor `<a>` tag provides a back link to the home page (`/`), styled using the `.back-link` class.\n\n6. **Bootstrap Bundle with Popper**:\n   - Bootstrap and Popper.js JavaScript is included through their CDN for possibly enabling Bootstrap's JavaScript components.\n\n**Additional Notes**: \n- The placeholder `{{ roast }}` suggests that this HTML is meant to be used with a templating engine (like Jinja2 for Python, Twig for PHP, etc.). The templating engine will replace the placeholder with the actual text of the roast when rendering the HTML to serve to the user.\n- The `<link>` and `<script>` tags for Bootstrap indicate a reliance on an external third-party library for design components and JavaScript functionality.\n- The document uses responsive design principles, as indicated by the viewport `<meta>` tag and Bootstrap's responsive CSS.\n- Popper.js is included as part of the Bootstrap bundle to position tooltips and popovers. However, there is no visible usage in the current HTML, suggesting it's included for future features or by standard practice when using Bootstrap.\n- The code lacks server-side scripting and is expected to be part of a web application where server-side code would dynamically generate the content for the placeholder.\n\nPlease ensure that the web server or framework you are using to serve this HTML supports the templating syntax and that Bootstrap's CDN is accessible when the HTML is loaded in the browser."}
